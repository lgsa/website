        Sad News:&nbsp; John Lingard has died.&nbsp; He was 90 on 19th May this year and
        made his usual inspiring visit to the 2005 reunion in the afternoon at
        Liskeard Public Hall.&nbsp; The funeral was private, for family only and at
        present there has been no indication of a Memorial Service.&nbsp; Members may
        wish to add&nbsp;a tribute to John Lingard - anecdotes would be very
        welcome.&nbsp; The photo is Sports Day 1961 with Head of Pendennis House

                Like so many of us, John Lingard touched my life. I recall his 
                example, his true modesty, his high personal standards and his 
                astounding ability to be fair. Even when standing before him, 
                guilty as sin, in the absence of evidence, you were innocent and 
                walked free. Well, perhaps not free, because you took with you 
                the knowledge that both parties knew you were guilty. but you, 
                the lesser being, did not have the moral fibre to own-up, whilst 
                he had administered true justice - and a lesson for life. <br>
                The next time, you owned-up. <br>
                One of my most valued possessions is a reference from him: a 
                document that I did not have the maturity to appreciate at 
                nineteen, but now, some forty years on, I can appreciate - the 
                combination of kindness, honesty and perception. Despite what we 
                may have thought of him at the time - a determination to ensure 
                that everyone achieved their academic best - his leadership was 
                about so much more; it was about helping us to be decent people.
                <br>
                He &amp; I did have our run-ins and he always saw fit - in my case, 
                at least - not to resort to the cane. At the end of my leaving 
                interview, I remarked on this. He gave me that slow smile with 
                his eyes half closed and feigned surprise. Now I know what he 
                was really thinking - thanks to him.</td>

                During my last year at LCGS I very vividly remember the horrible 
                ordeal of having to read the lesson for a whole week at a time.&nbsp; 
                You had to choose a passage from the Bible to fit in with that 
                day's hymn. Unfortunately, one morning the markers fell out, so 
                I just read from the first page that fell open. This 
                fortuitously didn't really matter as on one morning of that week 
                Mr Lingard said to me &quot;Although I was standing next to you I 
                couldn't hear a word&quot; That lunchtime I found myself in the Hall 
                standing at the lectern reading &quot;aloud&quot; to him, much to the 
                amusement of 2 or 3 boys in my form.&nbsp; Now my husband - but maybe 
                he is a trifle deaf - says he doesn't hear me!</td>

                I 
                am convinced that the current success of the LGSA is very much 
                thanks to Mr Lingards influence on the School . Before his 
                arrival , Liskeard Grammar was Dickensian in character . 
                Learning was by rote and it was not until his arrival that we, 
                the pupils, suddenly realised that education could be enjoyable 
                . So many thousands of former pupils have cause to be grateful 
                for his enthusiasm, dedication and love of his chosen 
                profession and he will be sorely missed as mentor, friend and 
                example</td>

                against doing P.E. We were told off but let off!. After coming 
                back to Cornwall in 1987, I visited him several times. He was so 
                interested in my activities, and very generous with the plants 
                he often gave me. Not only did he serve me well at school, but 
                he still does in my garden!</td>
