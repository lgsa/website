<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><u>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The Liskeard Grammar School Archives</span></u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In 2002 a large quantity of diaries, documents and 
photographs were handed to me by John Lingard.&nbsp; He asked the L.G.S.A. Committee 
to decide what to do with this archive material and the decision taken was to 
ask the County Records Office whether the material could be stored in their 
archives.&nbsp; The County Records Office agreed to accept the archive once it had 
been weeded and fully listed in preparation for inclusion as a County and 
National resource.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In February 2003 the bulk of the material was handed over 
to County Records with an additional deposit of Pupil record cards in July 
2003.&nbsp; The archive is now securely stored in acid free folders and under 
temperature controlled conditions.&nbsp; Duplicate material, removed in the weeding 
process, has been retained by LGSA.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Following enquiries as to how the archive may be viewed; I 
spent a day at County Records with Maggie Willan where we were able to select 
files of our choice and view those files within a few minutes.&nbsp; The archive has 
been given the Reference No. <u>AD1546</u> under which there are listed a total 
of 84 records.&nbsp; Internet access, to the list, is possible and a route to the 
list is shown below:-</p>
